**FrameScratch**

Thanks to the training of Grafikart, the objective here is not to make vulgar copy and paste of the training but rather to **understand all the concepts of object-oriented programming in PHP and strengthen an already solid foundation in order to apply them in a concrete case**, the code contained here was written **by hand** so.

Thanks for reading.
